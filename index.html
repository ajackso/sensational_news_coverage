	<h1>How US Audiences Talk About Disease</h1>
	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:14px; padding-top:10px;">By Aashka Dave, Andrea Jackson, Vivien Chen | MAS S.70 Final Project Fall 2017</p>
	<div id = "intro">
		<p>During a disease outbreak, people find themselves turning to two primary sources of information: public health organizations and news organizations. Generally speaking, news organizations report based on the information provided by public health organizations, but how they do so — the frequency with which they report, the type of reporting that takes place, and even the amount of detail in that reporting — can vary based on the organization and the disease. </p>

		<p>This project attempts to shed light on the different tactics news organizations may use when covering disease outbreaks. To do so, we examined regional news coverage in the United States during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the 2015 outbreak of Zika, which originated in South America and then came to the United States. </p>

		<p>To conduct this project, we pulled data from three sources: Media Cloud, a service that tracks news coverage from a number of news sources around the world, Data USA, a service that provides demographic information for the United States, and travel notices released by the Centers for Disease Control. We collected information on how often Ebola and Zika were mentioned by news outlets around the US, demographic information on various regions in the US, and the frequency with which Ebola and Zika were mentioned by the CDC in any given time period.
